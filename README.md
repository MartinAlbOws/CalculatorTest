# Home-Assignment

* The test is written in selenium using python 3.6.
* To run the test you just need to provide the 
    location of chromedriver in **chromedriver_path** in config.ini  
* I additionally added grabbing screenshots on failed results 
    only you need to adjust is to change the path in **local_path** in config.ini
* To check the snapshots just change the expected result to the incorrect option in **main_test.py**
